My name is **Dr. Denise Colombano**. I have the following qualities:

- I am obsessed with **estuaries**
- I am a **fish ecologist**
- I'm into **R**, spatial analysis, hierarchical models, graphics, & scientific illustrations
- I like to learn and apply **statistics** but am by no means an expert. I do the best I can to interrogate all statistical models!


### Education and Research Interests

I earned a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Biology & Management from the University of California, Davis in 2010. After studying the community ecology of littoral fish assemblages in Dr. Andy Sih's laboratory for three years, I started conducting my own research as a graduate student in the Graduate Group in Ecology. I earned a Ph.D. in Dr. Peter Moyle's laboratory in 2019.  My dissertation is titled, "Tidal marsh habitat use by fishes in the San Francisco Estuary" and is available by request. Currently, I am a post-doctoral scholar. I'm continuing my projects while looking for new opportunities.

My interests are nearshore ecology (particularly estuaries), tidal marshes, fish, food webs, hydrodynamics, tides, vegetation, habitat connectivity, terrestrial-aquatic linkages, and most of all, synthesizing datasets to better understand the natural history of species and their behavioral adaptations to dynamic estuarine environments.
