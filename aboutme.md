subtitle: Nerd things Denise is into...

My name is **Dr. Denise Colombano**. I have the following qualities:

- I am obsessed with **estuaries**
- I am a **fish ecologist**
- I'm into **R**, spatial analysis, hierarchical models, graphics, and scientific illustrations
- I like to learn and apply **statistics** but am by no means an expert. I do the best I can to interrogate all statistical models!


### Education and Research Interests

I earned a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Biology & Management from UC Davis in 2010. After learning about community ecology in Dr. Andy Sih's laboratory for three years as a technician, I started conducting my own research as a graduate student in the Graduate Group in Ecology. I earned a Ph.D. in Dr. Peter Moyle's laboratory in 2019. 

My dissertation is titled, "Tidal marsh habitat use by fishes in the San Francisco Estuary" and is available by request. Currently, I am a post-doctoral scholar at the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis, where I'm continuing my projects while looking for funding and collaborative opportunities.

My interests are nearshore ecology (particularly estuaries), tidal marshes, fish, food webs, hydrodynamics, tides, vegetation, habitat connectivity, terrestrial-aquatic linkages, and most of all, synthesizing datasets to better understand the natural history of species and their behavioral adaptations to dynamic estuarine environments.

I like to code in R, teach R, learn new techniques and statistical analyses, and share my knowledge with students and staff at UC Davis. I believe that the collective scientific enterprise requires inclusive and supportive work environments that foster creativity and productivity.
