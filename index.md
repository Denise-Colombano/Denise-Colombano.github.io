### Synopsis

My name is **Denise Colombano**. 

- I am a **fish ecologist**
- I am obsessed with **estuaries**
- I'm also into **R**, time-series models, spatially explicit models, hierarchical linear and non-linear models, dataviz, and scientific illustrations
- I like to learn and apply **statistics** but am by no means an expert. I do my best to interrogate all statistical models!


### Education and research interests

I earned a Ph.D. in Ecology in Dr. Peter Moyle's lab at UC Davis. My dissertation is titled, "Tidal marsh habitat use by fishes in the San Francisco Estuary" and is available by request. Currently, I am a postdoctoral scholar working under Professors Albert Ruhi and Stephanie Carlson ([See Ruhi Lab website](https://nature.berkeley.edu/ruhilab/lab-members/denise-colombano/)) in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management ([ESPM](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/)) at UC Berkeley. I'm working on:

- Climate change implications for tidal marsh food webs and linkages to estuarine and coastal nekton
- Climate change effects on long-term fish community stability
- Longfin smelt ecology in San Francisco Bay tributaries
- Developing a conceptual model, Mount to Marsh (M2M), describing how habitat mosaics and connectivity (e.g. marsh-upland gradients) influence habitat suitability for estuarine and migratory fishes across San Francisco Bay watersheds

My interests are nearshore ecology (particularly in estuaries), tidal marshes, fish, food webs, hydrodynamics, tides, vegetation, habitat connectivity, terrestrial-aquatic linkages, and climate change effects on flows. Most of all, I'm interested in synthesizing datasets in new ways to better understand the natural history of species and their behavioral adaptations to dynamic marine and estuarine environments. You can follow my current research on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denise_Colombano).

I like to code in R, teach R, learn new techniques and statistical analyses, and share my knowledge with students and staff. I believe that the collective scientific enterprise must prioritize equitable, inclusive, and supportive work environments that foster creativity and productivity for everyone.
